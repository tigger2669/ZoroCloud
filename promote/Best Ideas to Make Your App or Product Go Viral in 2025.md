## Leverage Product Hunt and Influencers

Product Hunt is a powerful platform for promoting your product. Influencers on Product Hunt, called "hunters," have a large following and can significantly boost your product's visibility.

### Tips to Succeed on Product Hunt:
1. **Collaborate with Top Hunters:** Identify influential hunters through tools like the [Product Hunt Leaderboard](https://upvote-bell.com/leaderboard). Book them at least two months in advance to ensure your product gets maximum exposure.
2. **Timing Matters:** Avoid launching on U.S. holidays. Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays are high-traffic days on Product Hunt.
3. **Set Clear Goals:** Decide if your objective is to win "Product of the Day" or maximize awareness. Launching on weekends often results in less competition.

## Key Concepts of Affiliate Marketing

Affiliate marketing is built on a simple revenue-sharing model that connects three key parties:

1. **The Merchant**: The company selling a product or service.
2. **The Affiliate (You)**: The promoter driving traffic to the merchant's offering.
3. **The Consumer**: The individual purchasing through your referral link.

### Popular Revenue Models

- **Pay-per-click (PPC)**: Get paid for every click, regardless of sales.
- **Pay-per-lead (PPL)**: Receive payment when users sign up or take another predefined action.

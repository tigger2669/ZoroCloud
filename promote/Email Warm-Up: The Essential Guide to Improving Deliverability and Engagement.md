## What is Email Warm-Up?

**Email warm-up** is the process of gradually increasing the volume and frequency of emails sent from a new or dormant IP address or domain. The goal is to build a positive reputation with Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and inbox providers, ensuring your emails are recognized as legitimate and not flagged as spam.

### Why is Email Warm-Up Important?

Hereâ€™s why email warm-up is critical:

1. **Improved Deliverability**: Helps ensure your emails reach the inbox instead of being flagged as spam.
2. **Better Engagement Rates**: Higher chances of recipients opening, clicking, and interacting with your emails.
3. **Positive Sender Reputation**: Builds trust with ISPs, which is essential for maintaining long-term email success.

## How to Warm Up Your Email

To successfully warm up your email address, follow these best practices:

### Step 1: Start Slow
Begin by sending a small number of emails to your most engaged usersâ€”those who are most likely to open and interact with your messages. This helps establish a positive engagement history early on.

### Step 2: Gradually Increase Volume
Each week, slowly increase the number of emails sent. For example:

- **Week 1**: 50 emails/day
- **Week 2**: 100 emails/day
- **Week 3**: 200 emails/day

Continue this gradual ramp-up while monitoring metrics closely.

### Step 3: Authenticate Your Emails
Set up email authentication protocols like SPF (Sender Policy Framework), DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail), and DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance). These protocols signal to ISPs that your emails are trustworthy and legitimate.

### Step 4: Monitor Engagement Metrics
Track key metrics such as:

- **Open Rates**: Ensure a high percentage of recipients are opening your emails.
- **Click-Through Rates**: Indicates how engaging your content is.
- **Spam Complaints**: Minimize complaints to maintain a good sender reputation.

### Step 5: Maintain List Hygiene
Regularly clean your email list by removing inactive or invalid addresses. Sending emails to such addresses can harm your reputation and reduce deliverability.
